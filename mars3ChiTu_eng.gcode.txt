;CLEANING PREVIOUS PARAMETERS PRIOR TO SETTING NEW ONES
M8513

;STEPPER MOTOR DIRECTIONS
;I1 and I-1 are opposite directions. So, if the motor moves in the incorrect direction, revert these parameters.
M8002 I-1 ;X stepper motor direction
M8003 I1  ;Y stepper motor direction
M8004 I-1 ;Z stepper motor direction

;Z-AXIS MANUAL INTERFACE BUTTONS DIRECTION
M8005 Z0 ;0: Z-axis moves up
         ;1: Z-axis moves down

;Z-AXIS INITIAL SPEED
;The Speeds are measured in mm/s and the acceleration in mm/s^2.
;Maximum initial speed (Note: If the movement speed exceeds this speed, it will use this speed as the initial speed)
;The initial speed is mainly to prevent step skipping. (Attention: If the inicial speed value is too small, it will cause angular protrusions when printing circles).
M8006 I30 

;MAX JERK SPEED		  
;The jerk speed value (corresponding to jerk speed in open-source firmware). If the actual jerk speed of the movement is greater than this value,
;it will force the movement to decelerate. When filling, there will be a lot of back and forth movement. A large value causes noise and is prone to cause step skipping.
;A small value results in slow speed. When printing at high speeds, print quality may be relatively poor.
M8007 I15 		
		
;ACCELERATION
;The larger this value, the greater the average speed of the actual operation, but also noisier. A smaller value results in a smaller actual speed.		
M8008 I1000 

;AXIS MOVEMENT - STEPS PER MM (DO NOT TOUCH IF YOUR PRINTER USES THE OEM STEPPER MOTOR!)
;After setting these parameters, please print a cube and measure the dimensions with a ruler to confirm that the parameters are correct.
;For example, with 20 teeth and a pitch of 2mm (MXL specification, 2GT pitch is 2mm), 1.8-degree stepper motor, 16 subdivisions, it is (20*2)/((360/1.8)*16)
;If you need to independently set X and Y stepper motor parameters, you can use M8009 X0.0125 Y0.0125
M8009 S0.0125 
M8010 S0.000625 ;On non-delta machines, the formula is: lead / ((360/1.8)*16).

;AXIS MOVEMENT SPEED
;To ensure machine stability, set according to actual test results.
M8012 I200 ;Maximum speed of XY movement in mm/s
M8013 I5   ;Maximum speed of Z movement in mm/s

;HOMING SPEED
M8015 I3   ;First homing speed (faster). The manual interface's Z movement and Z-axis lifting will follow the same value
M8016 I1.5 ;Second homing speed (slower). Smaller speeds can improve the home positioning accuracy. If this parameter is 0, the second homing will not be performed.
M8015 S30  ;Homing speed when XY is homed (fast). The manual interface's XY movement and XY axis movements will follow the same value.

;Z-AXIS DISTANCES AND SPEEDS DURING DEMOLD
;During the demolding process, the Z-axis will rise slowly, then quickly, stays for a while, start descending quickly, and finally descend slowly.
M8070 S3.0 ;Ascent distance in mm
M8021 S1.7 ;Descent distance in mm
M8015 P1.0 ;Slower Ascent speed in mm/s
M8020 S1.0 ;Slower Descent speed in mm/s
M8028 S3.0 ;Faster Ascent speed in mm/s
M8016 P3.0 ;Faster Descent speed in mm/s (In older boards, the M8016 value is used for the fast ascent and slow descent speeds)

;Z-AXIS MOVEMENT DURING PRINT
;If Z movement is not needed, set it to 0
M8070 Z7 

;WAITING TIME AFTER Z-AXIS RAISES
M8016 D0 ;Milliseconds

;MAX TRAVEL DISTANCES
M8024 I0   ;Maximum travel distance for X-axis. The X-axis can be used for demolding or scraping. If you machine has only the Z-Axis, set this value to zero.
M8025 I0   ;Maximum travel distance for Y-axis. The Y-axis is used to block the lens of the projector. It blocks the lens at the zero position during homing and does not block it at the maximum travel position. If you machine has only the Z-Axis, set this value to zero.
M8026 I175 ;Maximum travel distance for Z-axis. The Max Z-axis travel for Mars 3 PRO is 175mm. After pausing and printing completion, the Z-axis will stay at the maximum travel position.

;LIMIT SWITCH CONFIGURATION
